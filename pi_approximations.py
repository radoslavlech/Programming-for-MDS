Write a program that calculates 10 000 consecutive approximations of π
according to the Wallis formula:

           ∞     4 n²
    π = 2  ∏   ————————
          n=1  4 n² - 1


The above formula is exact for the infinite product. In successive
approximations, the value of n varies from 1 to some number N. Successive
approximations are the calculated values for the increasing upper limit N.

Every hundredth approximation (for N ∈ 100, 200, 300...) should be displayed
on the screen:
