# Quadratic Equation

Please write a code that calculates real roots of a quadratic equation of the form

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>a</em> <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>b</em> <em>x</em> + <em>c</em> = 0</p>

For the coefficients defined at the beginning of the program in the appropriate variables. Calculation result must be stored
in a tuple named `xx` and printed at the very end of the program.

In the file `exercise1.py` there is a program template with the definition of example equation parameters. It needs to be completed.

**Hint:** To compute a square root, you may raise a number to the power of 0.5 (like `9**0.5`).
